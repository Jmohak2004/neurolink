/**
 * The live gate, shown failing and passing against an endpoint this suite owns.
 *
 * `continuous-test-suite-provider-matrix.ts` is the nightly sweep. Run live, its
 * verdicts depend on what the real vendors answer that night, so nothing about
 * the gate itself (a keyed provider answering 401 must FAIL, not skip) could be
 * shown by running it. Here the vendor is a local HTTP server that answers 200,
 * 401, 402, 429 or 503 on demand, the matrix suite is started as a child process
 * exactly as the workflow starts it, and the assertions read its exit code and
 * its output. Only the built package is involved (`dist/`, through the matrix
 * suite and the shared provider table); nothing is imported from `src/lib`.
 *
 * Determinism is what the owned server buys: a live call cannot be made to
 * return a 401 for a key that works, a 429 on cue, or the same 200 eight times.
 * No credential is used: the "key" is a fixture string, and the suite's own
 * environment is scrubbed by credentialFreeEnv before any child starts.
 *
 * What it proves, each as a separate case:
 *   - a provider that has its secret and answers 401, 402 or 429 FAILS every
 *     cell, and the failure line carries the HTTP status and the vendor code
 *   - the same 401 for a provider on the allowlist is excused and printed
 *   - the same 401 once that allowlist entry has expired FAILS again
 *   - a provider with no secret is skipped in one quiet line, with no SDK call
 *     and no ERROR log
 *   - a transient 503 stays a skip, and does not count as passed
 *   - 200 passes, and the coverage table counts it
 *   - the coverage floor fails a run with too few passing providers, passes one
 *     with enough, and is not enforced when the workflow does not ask
 *
 * "Today" is pinned with NEUROLINK_LIVE_GATE_TODAY so the allowlist cases mean
 * the same thing after the real entries expire.
 *
 * Run: pnpm run test:live-gate
